# ESO-value
Receiving stock options from your company? Wondering what they are worth? ESO-value calculates the value of
Employee Stock Options based on the Hull-White model[1][2].

## Installation
Run `pip install esovalue`

## Usage
```python
from esovalue.eso import value_eso

value_eso(strike_price=50, stock_price=50, volatility=0.3, risk_free_rate=0.075,
          dividend_rate=0.025, exit_rate=0.03, vesting_years=3, expiration_years=10, 
          iterations=1000, m=3)
```
Description of the parameters:

expiration_years	- Years until expiration

                          (exercise when the strike_price*m >= stock_price)
